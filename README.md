# Queue Anxiety RL Agent
Intelligent queue selection using Reinforcement Learning in a stochastic supermarket environment.
This project models the real-world phenomenon of “queue anxiety,” where customers must choose a checkout line without knowing how long each queue will actually take. Each customer in a queue has a different service speed and may trigger random delays (e.g., coupon search, price check, returning to shelves), creating uncertainty and making naive heuristics unreliable.
